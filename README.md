# Challenge1

This is a file for the first challenge.

* I have changed a "div" element into a "nav" elements on lines 14 and 26 to allow for easier reading.

* I also changed the "id" of the search-engine-optimization on line 31 to move the webpage to reflect when the "Search Engine Optimization" tab is clicked on.

* Changed "div" on lines 31 and 37 to refect a "section" thus not mudding up the code with too many div elements.

* changed "div" on lines 38 and 44 to a "section"

* changed "div" on lines 45 and 51 to a "section"

* updated all images to contain "alt" tags
